# Patched Fonts

Patched fonts from "NerdFonts" and the like. These fonts are very useful for rendering Icons in various sort of command line tools (text or code editors for example). 

I'm currently using Jetbrains Mono **Patched** font for a better experience when using Neovim and the console in general. It has ligatures and some Icons that are rendered by Neovim / Vim file explorer plugins. It's also very easy to read and beautiful in my opinion.

## Installation in Unix system (Linux, MacOS).

1. Download the patched font you want to use
2. Copy it into the folder **~/.local/share/fonts**

You could also copy the font into a subdirectory for better organization, for example:

> ~/.local/share/fonts/MyAwesomePatchedFont
