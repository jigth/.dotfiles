# My Neovim Configuration

It's been made to support development in Neovim providing:

## Recomendation

For better readability I recommend:

1. Use some patched font from [NerdFonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
2. keeping the Gruvbox-Material theme (or using something similarly good).

## Features

* Linting

* Blazing fast autocompletion

* Snippets support

* Comfy Navigation with EasyMotion Plugin **(space, space, s)**

* Great fuzzy finding capabilities

* Remaps that improve speed and comfort

* Relatively lightweight setup (not a big resource hogger)

* Support for any language I want to develop with (using Neovim LSP) 
    * For example:
        * VueJS + Typescript.
        * HTML, CSS, JS, Nunjucks, etc.

* You could change Neovim LSP for another completion plugin such as YouCompleteMe or CoC. I use LSP because it's waay lighter and faster.
